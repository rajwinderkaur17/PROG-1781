<p>Before we get into the benefits of yoga, it is important to understand what yoga really is. Many people call 
it an ancient method of training, and others call it a set of difficult poses. But the word ‘yoga’ actually means
 union. It is a practice that connects the body, mind, and spirit through different body postures, meditation, and
 controlled breathing.

The renowned Yogi, Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev calls yoga “an expression of life.” He says, “Yoga essentially means 
finding the keys to the nature of the existence.”Yoga is not just about bending or twisting the body and holding 
the breath. It is a mechanism to bring you into a state where you see and experience reality just the way it is. 
If you allow your energies to become exuberant and ecstatic, your sensory body expands. This enables you to experie
nce the whole universe as a part of yourself, making everything one – this is the union that yoga creates.


The founder of Yoga, Patanjali said, “Sthiram sukham asanam.” It means that a posture that seems firm and 
comfortable is your asana. You might be surprised to know that an asana is only a preparatory step in the practice
 of yoga. It is a means that helps you achieve the greater good. Yoga aims to create perfect harmony between your
 mind, body, and spirit. When you fine-tune yourself so that everything functions wonderfully within you, you will
 bring out the best of your abilities.</p>
